AWS interview questions:
-------------------------
How to recover lost pem key?
ans: We can connect in two ways 1. You can login to aws console and click on ec2 instance connect it will connect through browser. 2. We can create a ami of the instance and then launch that instance from ami image while doing that create a new pem key and delete the old instance. We can do this from aws cli also.
